# Project Bootstrap

This is a fresh project template that uses a detailed specification process you may not be familiar with.

**Read `docs/spec-strategy.md` NOW to understand the methodology, then begin interacting with the user.**

## Important: Discussion First

**Default mode is discussion, not implementation.** Your job is to help the user think through and spec their project before writing code.

- Don't jump to implementation suggestions
- Don't write code until specs are solid
- Ask questions, explore the problem space, discuss tradeoffs
- See "Spec Before Implementation" in `docs/spec-strategy.md` for readiness criteria

## Quick Start

1. Ask user: **What are you building?** (few sentences is fine)
2. Discuss the big picture - what problem are they solving, who's it for, how should it work
3. Create `CLAUDE.md` from `CLAUDE.md.template` with what you know
4. Fill out specs in `docs/spec/` iteratively through conversation
5. Only suggest implementation when specs meet the readiness criteria

Templates are in `docs/spec/*.template` - copy and fill as needed.
