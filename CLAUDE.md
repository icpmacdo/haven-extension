# Project Bootstrap

This is a fresh project template that uses a detailed specification process you may not be familiar with.

**Read `docs/spec-strategy.md` NOW to understand the methodology, then begin interacting with the user.**

## Quick Start

1. Ask user: **What are you building?** (few sentences is fine)
2. Create `CLAUDE.md` from `CLAUDE.md.template` with what you know
3. Discuss and fill out specs in `docs/spec/` iteratively

Templates are in `docs/spec/*.template` - copy and fill as needed.
